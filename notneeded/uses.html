<h1>A. Building Capacity/ Training</h1>
<h2>A1. Recruitment, Selection, and Onboarding</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recruitment</strong>:&nbsp; The practice of soliciting and actively seeking applicants to fill recently vacated or newly created positions using a variety of methods (i.e., internal job postings, advertising in newspapers or electronic job boards/sites, utilizing search firms, or listing position with trade and professional associations, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>:&nbsp; Any step, combination of steps or procedure used as a basis for any employment decision, including, but not limited to, informal or casual interviews, unscored application forms, paper and pencil tests, performance tests, training programs, probationary periods and physical, education and work experience requirements, as well as the decision-making process used in determining whether or not to hire or promote.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong>:&nbsp; The introduction of employees to their jobs, co-workers, and the organization by providing them with information regarding such items as policies, procedures, company history, goals, culture, and work rules.</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding</strong>:&nbsp; Onboarding is the process by which new hires get adjusted to the social and performance aspects of their jobs quickly and smoothly, and learn the attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors required to function effectively within an organization. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following chart from the Federal Office of Personnel Management describes the difference between the two:</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Recruitment and selection in state systems is often governed by rules from the State&rsquo;s human resource/personnel office.&nbsp; Many states now have automated job application systems where all job applicants are required to apply.&nbsp; However, most states allow discretion in marketing vacant positions in places other than the state&rsquo;s job portal.&nbsp; As with other state systems, it is important that VR agencies comply with all state and umbrella agency rules and regulations regarding recruitment and selection.&nbsp; If recruitment or selection is included in any collective bargaining agreement with unions, then that agreement must be followed and any changes normally have to be formally agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>Many states, at a minimum, offer formalized training on the use of the automated job application system and some offer training on related issues such as watching out for bias in the recruitment and selection process.&nbsp; It is recommended that supervisors take advantage of any such training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some states have developed statewide onboarding or new employee orientation programs.&nbsp; A few of these programs have been automated.&nbsp; Additionally, some VR agencies have also developed their own programs.</p>
<p>This toolkit includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning for Recruitments</li>
<li>Developing a Recruitment Plan</li>
<li>Selection</li>
<li>Onboarding and New Employee Orientation

<li>Basic Orientation Components</li>
<li>VR Specific Orientation Components</li>
<li>Links to sample VR Orientation Programs</li>
<li>Links to sample Statewide Orientation Programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Planning for Recruitments</h1>
<p>The VR agency&rsquo;s recruitment planning process should be an extension of the agency&rsquo;s workforce plan.&nbsp; The workforce plan should be the guidepost for determining the recruitment process.&nbsp; It should help answer the following questions as you consider how to recruit for a position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the position be reclassified before the recruitment or should it be filled as is?</li>
<li>Is this a traditionally hard to fill position where special recruitment techniques are needed?</li>
<li>Do the demographics of our agency match the demographics of our clients? If not, which populations should be highlighted in the recruitment plan?</li>
<li>Are there individuals in the agency&rsquo;s succession planning process that might be ready to fill the vacancy or is an external recruitment necessary?</li>
<li>Has an individual submitted his/her retirement papers, and does your state allow a dual incumbency (two people in the same position) so that the newly hired individual can work for a short time with the person retiring for training purposes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is important to determine if the vacancy is subject to any conditions of a collective bargaining agreement and whether or not there is an existing register of applicants which would limit new recruitment opportunities.</p>
<p>If the answer to the above questions indicate that there are no major issues, then your agency may not need a formal recruitment plan.&nbsp; Just follow your state rules for filling a vacancy.</p>
<h1>Developing a Recruitment Plan</h1>
<p>When there are some recruitment issues, it is recommended to use an EXCEL spreadsheet to develop a recruitment plan.&nbsp; The complexity of the recruitment plan will be dependent on the number of recruitment issues.&nbsp; Suggested headings for the plan are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue</li>
<li>Potential Solutions (Note that there may be several for a single issue)</li>
<li>Action Steps</li>
<li>Lead Staff</li>
<li>Other Staff Required</li>
<li>Contractor Required</li>
<li>Costs</li>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Significant Milestones</li>
<li>Policy/Procedure Implications</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an example of a single issue Recruitment plan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Selection</h1>
<p>Once the list of applicants is received, it is important to follow a consistent and objective hiring process that is fair to all qualified applicants.&nbsp; Following the suggestions in the separately included Hiring Managers Guide should assist in this process.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if applicant lists consistently do not include specific types of applicants (e.g., individuals with disabilities or African-Americans) despite targeted recruitment efforts, then work with your human resource representative to see if these individuals are being lost during the recruitment or screening process.&nbsp; If they are, then strategies to prevent this should be developed.</p>
<p>A sample hiring managers&rsquo; guide is provided at the end of this toolkit.</p>
<h1>Onboarding and New Employee Orientation</h1>
<p><strong><u>Basic Orientation Components</u></strong></p>
<p>Often each state&rsquo;s human resource/personnel office will have a general new employee orientation program for all state employees.&nbsp; It is recommended that any VR agency&rsquo;s new employee orientation/on-boarding program begins with these materials.&nbsp; These statewide materials are normally found in one of three forms.&nbsp; The first is an online manual.&nbsp; An example of this is the state of New York as found in the following link, <a href="http://goer.ny.gov/employee_resources/orientation/NYSOrientationHandbook.pdf">http://goer.ny.gov/employee_resources/orientation/NYSOrientationHandbook.pdf</a>.&nbsp; Another format is an independent online program.&nbsp; An example of this is the state of Delaware as found in the following link, <a href="http://www.delawarepersonnel.com/neo/index.shtml">http://www.delawarepersonnel.com/neo/index.shtml</a>.&nbsp; The third format is an online program that is part of the state&rsquo;s enterprise human resource system or as part of the state&rsquo;s automated hiring system.&nbsp; An example of this can be found in the state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The link to that program can be found in their on-boarding handbook found in Appendix A.&nbsp; That handbook has links for both recent new hires as well as a link for future employees with a job offer as a valid employee ID is required to access that system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Society for Human Resource Management has a comprehensive publication on onboarding new employees which can be found at <a href="http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/products/Documents/Onboarding%20EPG-%20FINAL.pdf">http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/products/Documents/Onboarding%20EPG-%20FINAL.pdf</a>.</p>
<p><strong>_____________________________</strong></p>
<p>No matter the format, the basic new employee orientation materials tend to contain the following:</p>
<p>-A welcome section which may be in the form of a video by the Governor or agency head.</p>
<p>-Information about where to find more information.</p>
<p>-Employee benefits and services such as direct deposit, pay schedules, pre-tax savings programs, life insurance, wellness programs, employee assistance programs and other benefits available in an individual state.</p>
<p>-Health benefits information including vision and dental if available.</p>
<p>-Information about the state&rsquo;s pension or retirement programs.</p>
<p>-Information on all available leave benefits such as vacation leave, holidays, sick leave, leave donation, and special leaves such as jury duty.</p>
<p>-General state policies such as sexual harassment prevention, ethics, drug and alcohol free workplace, and equal opportunity employment.</p>
<p>-Overall employment information such as performance evaluations, disciplinary procedures, etc.</p>
<p>-Career development and training opportunities.</p>
<p>-How to apply for promotional opportunities.</p>
<p>-Information about the overall state government such as other governmental agencies and the state travel policy.</p>
<p><u>Checklists</u></p>
<p>Many programs have available checklists for new employees and for their supervisors.&nbsp; The checklists for new employees can be divided into pre-employment, first day, first week, and later periods of time.&nbsp; Often these checklists end upon satisfactory completion of the employee&rsquo;s first year of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pre-employment checklist may remind the employee to check all the information and follow the instructions of their appointment letter, and it may suggest that employees complete the new employee orientation program if it is available online.&nbsp; In addition, the pre-employment checklist may remind the future employee to bring all materials required for the I-9 form on his/her first day.&nbsp; Finally, it often tells future employees to relax that there are people to answer their questions and help them successfully transition into their new role.</p>
<p>The first day checklist for the employee typically has a follow-up reminder for the I-9 materials and other new hire materials.&nbsp; There is usually a notice that they should be meeting with their supervisor who will have their own checklist to ensure the proper orientation of the new employee.</p>
<p>During the first week, or soon thereafter, other checklists may include a reminder to complete any required training programs (such as Sexual Harassment Prevention), to make sure job performance expectations are clarified, and to investigate any development programs such as completing a career development plan.</p>
<p>Examples of checklists can be found as part of the state of Pennsylvania handbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Buddy Program</u></p>
<p>One option for orienting new employees is to establish a buddy program.&nbsp; This is where a co-worker is assigned to help the new employee navigate the new organization as well as to provide a social support such as a lunch companion during the first week of employment.&nbsp; Here is a link to the buddy program at MIT, <a href="https://welcome.mit.edu/managers/tools/buddy">https://welcome.mit.edu/managers/tools/buddy</a> as well as another program at the USDA, <a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/hrdapp?area=home&amp;subject=nwem&amp;topic=bdp">http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/hrdapp?area=home&amp;subject=nwem&amp;topic=bdp</a>.&nbsp; Information on the buddy program at NYU can be found in Appendix C.</p>
<p><u>Mentoring Program</u></p>
<p>Another option for assisting new employees is a mentoring program.&nbsp; Since this program is also valuable for current employees, it is included in the Retention toolkit.</p>
<p><strong><u>VR Specific Orientation Components</u></strong></p>
<p>In addition to information and programs applicable to any state organization, new VR employees require information specific to the VR agency and their own new position.&nbsp; If the VR agency or the new employee&rsquo;s office has additional rules relating to any items in the state handbook/programs, then the new employee should be informed of that information.&nbsp; After that it is important that employees receive information to help them successfully perform their job.&nbsp; Important components include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agency mission, vision, guiding principles and beliefs</li>
<li>Instruction on use of any automated systems (case management, employee HR self-service, etc.). Often these programs have previously developed documentation which can be relied upon to assist in training new employees.</li>
<li>Agency policies and procedures</li>
<li>Specific information on what is expected of them when they receive their performance evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>VR specific new employee orientation/onboarding programs vary greatly across states.&nbsp; The next section highlights programs in several states which can be used utilized as a base for creating a program appropriate for your state.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sample VR Orientation Programs</u></strong></p>
<p>This section includes links to sample orientation materials from the state of Nebraska, the state of Florida, and the state of Delaware (whose program is based on materials from the state of Washington).</p>
<h1>Sample State Level Onboarding Program</h1>
<p>The following link is to the written handbook from the state of Pennsylvania which accompanies its automated program.&nbsp; The handbook includes useful checklists and letters/emails for both the new employee and the new employee&rsquo;s supervisor.</p>

<h2>A2. Staff Development &amp; Training</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career development:&nbsp;&nbsp; The process by which individuals establish their current and future career objectives and assess their existing skills, knowledge or experience levels and implement an appropriate course of action to attain their desired career objectives.</p>
<p>Career counseling: &nbsp;Guiding individuals through the career planning and career decision-making process by helping them to make informed decisions regarding educational and occupational choices, as well as providing resources needed to further developing job search and placement skills.</p>
<p>Career development:&nbsp; The process by which individuals establish their current and future career objectives and assess their existing skills, knowledge or experience levels and implement an appropriate course of action to attain their desired career objectives.</p>
<p>Career mobility:&nbsp; The propensity to make several career changes during an individual&rsquo;s lifetime instead of committing to a long-term career within a specific occupational field.</p>
<p>Career path:&nbsp; The progression of jobs in an organization&rsquo;s specific occupational fields ranked from lowest to highest in the hierarchal structure.</p>
<p>Career planning:&nbsp; The process of establishing career objectives and determining appropriate educational and developmental programs to further develop the skills required to achieve short- or long-term career objectives.</p>
<p>Training and development:&nbsp; A process dealing primarily with transferring or obtaining knowledge, attitudes and skills needed to carry out a specific activity or task.</p>
<p>Training needs analysis:&nbsp; A method used to determine what people need to learn and which training programs may be beneficial. The result of the analysis is a training needs report identifying training needs and the interventions needed to reduce key performance gaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Staff development and training is of critical import to a VR agency&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; Not only does it assist with employee retention, it is important in maximizing effective performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus can be on training and developing the employee for optimal performance in their current job or to promote readiness for future jobs.&nbsp; This toolkit includes the following sections and/or links:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Determine Training Needs</li>
<li>How to Track Training</li>

<p>Note that a sample training policy and other relevant forms can be found at the following link (link to rETENTION SECTION OF TOOLKIT ASSET ID <strong>US D. OBW2</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How to Determine Training Needs</h1>
<p>A typical way that organizations determine training needs is by surveying employees.&nbsp; This can provide valuable feedback, but employees may not know which training needs are most critical.&nbsp; Employees often focus on items such as stress reduction training. &nbsp;Stress reduction training can be useful, but the more immediate need, as an example, may be training on how to more effectively use the new case management system which is a source of that stress.</p>
<p>Other equally important sources for determining training needs may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of performance planning and review documents which may indicate training needs</li>
<li>Analysis of employee career planning documents</li>
<li>Results of case reviews and other quality assurance processes</li>
<li>Strategic, workforce and succession planning documents</li>
<li>Recommendations from employee committees (i.e., diversity committee)</li>
<li>Reviewing grievance and disciplinary documents</li>
<li>Analysis of other employee surveys such as organizational climate or employee engagement</li>
<li>Determining what training opportunities employees need for licensing and certification</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this process less daunting, have someone responsible for training that can review many of the above documents as they are made available through the year.&nbsp; If this individual is not privy to confidential employee information, then have that individual work with supervisors or the agency&rsquo;s human resource representative to obtain this information without attached names.&nbsp; A spreadsheet should be developed which indicates the frequency cited and source of each training need.&nbsp; VR leadership should make decisions, based upon this data, as to how potentially limited training resources (in terms of time and/or money) will be spent.&nbsp; Training plans can then be developed for the agency as a whole as well as for individual employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the training strategies section for ideas on how to maximize training resources.</p>
<h1>How to Track Training</h1>
<p>If your state has an available automated training tracking system, that is the often the best resource to utilized.&nbsp; Some automated training systems may be linked to career or performance plans to facilitate the determination of training needs as mentioned above.&nbsp; The best systems allow employees to enter their own data which can be reviewed by their supervisor for accuracy and to ensure data entry compliance.&nbsp; This distribution of effort can free up the training coordinator for more important tasks.</p>
<p>If an automated training tracking system is not available, then providing an easy to fill spreadsheet is another possibility.&nbsp; It can be as simple as the name, data, and title of the training along with the associated number of training hours.&nbsp; Supervisors should review this data routinely with employees, preferably as part of the career planning or performance planning process.&nbsp; Employees should be reminded that such spreadsheets can also be important at job interviews as evidence of their on-going development activities.</p>
<p>Remember that what is tracked is valued.&nbsp; Since employee development and training assists employee retention, by tracking their training, employees become more cognizant of all the training they are offered by the agency increasing retention efforts.&nbsp; Any training tracking options should be integrated and aligned with processes such as the development of career plans.</p>
<h1>Ideas for &ldquo;Growing Your Own&rdquo;</h1>
<p>As mentioned in the Recruitment section of this toolkit, organizations are more likely to retain good employees if employees see opportunities for promotion. The agency can develop internal promotion policies or guidelines.&nbsp; For many employees, these promotional opportunities are not realistic without further training and development.&nbsp; For this reason, career and succession planning efforts are vital.&nbsp; Some of the options that can be offered as part of these efforts, in addition to traditional classroom training, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-training</li>
<li>Job Shadowing</li>
<li>On-the job Training</li>
<li>Coaching/Mentoring</li>
<li>Developmental/Special Assignments (appointment to committees, research projects, etc.)</li>
<li>Job Enrichment or Enhancement</li>
<li>Conferences</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of all the tools a VR agency utilizes in preparing clients for employment.&nbsp; These same tools can be ideas for developing VR employees.</p>
<h1>Training Strategies</h1>
<p>When training funds are limited, it is important to do the following:</p>
<p>-Prioritize training needs as per the above discussion on determining training needs.</p>
<p>-Look for available free resources (including internal state and agency resources).&nbsp; Check to see if you have employees that have experience as a trainer or presenter.&nbsp; If you have an employee where training is part of their career plan, invest dollars into assisting them develop a training skill set that can be used by your organization.</p>
<p>-Determine what training must be VR specific and what does not need to be VR specific.&nbsp; Knowledge of vocational rehabilitation, disabilities, WIOA, VR case management systems are examples of training topics that should relate specifically to VR.&nbsp; These are topics where training is likely needed to be developed in-house, shared from another VR or similar agency, made available through a related professional association such as CSAVR or NRA, or found via college and university VR/disability programs.&nbsp; Other training topics that are non-VR specific such as supervision, leadership, project management, problem solving, and management of government administrative processes are opportunities to utilize existing programs without the need for each VR program to create and administer its own program or training.&nbsp; By utilizing pre-developed external programs, the VR agency can channel its resources into more specific VR training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Remember that training and development does not always mean classroom training so take advantage of the strategies listed in the above &ldquo;Grow Your Own&rdquo; section to expand your training toolkit.</p>
<p>-Consider a library of training resources such as books and DVDs which employees can borrow.&nbsp; Employees may be willing to donate or at least share such resources.&nbsp; Through sharing, some books have been known to make their way across state government agencies</p>
<h1>Employee Development and Career Planning</h1>
<p>Career development plans can serve to assist employees as they prepare for other positions, usually at higher levels in the organization.&nbsp; Career development plans can be part of the agency&rsquo;s succession planning process; help employees determine what is required for a promotion or to transfer to a desired position; or to assist employees in excelling in their current job. Annual performance reviews provide a possible opportunity each year to discuss employee&rsquo;s career development plans although it is recommended that a separate meeting be held because of the potential anxiety around the performance review process.</p>
<p>Doing career planning should be more than filling out a form.&nbsp; It is helpful to start the process by taking time for self-discovery.&nbsp; There are a large variety of tools that can be utilized including a personalized SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis and assessments such as Myers-Briggs&reg;, DISC&reg;, StrengthsFinder&reg;, etc.&nbsp; An employee should also look at political, technological, economic, and social-cultural factors that may impact their career choice.&nbsp; VR agencies are increasingly looking at Labor Market Information to assist VR clients, but this same data can be useful to VR employees when reviewing their own careers.&nbsp; Another suggested option is going through the Covey Seven Habits&reg; process to create personal mission statements and goals.</p>
<p>In addition to personal or core competencies, individuals should develop a comprehensive list of their skills, qualifications, and experiences.&nbsp; When this list is compared to the needed skills, qualifications, competencies, and experiences needed for any desired position, the focus for the employee development and career plan emerges.&nbsp; It is this identified gap where strategies are needed to obtain the missing skills, etc.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia, Canada has excellent resources on government career development which can be found at <a href="http://novascotia.ca/psc/employeeCentre/careerDevelopment/">http://novascotia.ca/psc/employeeCentre/careerDevelopment/</a>.&nbsp; A copy of their career development plan guide can be found at this link.&nbsp; Another interesting resource is the United States Geological Survey which can be found at <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/humancapital/ecd/ecd_tensteps.html">http://www.usgs.gov/humancapital/ecd/ecd_tensteps.html</a>.</p>
<p><u>Encouraging Career Planning in Your Organization</u></p>
<p>Career planning should be a voluntary process.&nbsp; All employees should have access to the process, but have the option to decline participating.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; The sample form has a section to allow employees to opt out.)</p>
<p>Since it is a voluntary process, it is important to encourage employees to participate as this is beneficial to the individual and the organization.&nbsp; The reaction of employees is often flavored by whether the organization will provide funds and/or work time to participate in the training or experiences outlined in the plan.&nbsp; The extent of the organization&rsquo;s capability to offer funding or work time will have a direct relationship to the success of the career planning process.</p>
<p>Another fun way to get employees interested in their own career planning is to provide work time and resources for the self-discovery activities mentioned earlier such as taking the DISC&reg;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, particularly with small agencies, some of the career plans may need to include working toward positions in other state agencies.&nbsp; For example if the VR agency has a limited number of managerial positions available, it may be helpful for the employee to spend time (either through actual promotion or through a formal training experience) in another related organization such as developmental disabilities or mental health.&nbsp; The managerial skills and experiences acquired in the other agency can then be transferred back to the VR agency when promotional opportunities become available.&nbsp; This is particularly important in parts of the country where organizations outside of state government are highly competitive in recruiting VR staff.</p>
<p>While supervisors tend to be the point of contact for the employee on career planning, other individuals (a regional manager, a HR representative, etc.) should be available in case the employee feels uncomfortable working with their current supervisor.&nbsp; Despite the importance of career planning, the first goal is satisfactory performance in the employee&rsquo;s current job.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Developing Supervisors, Managers, and Leaders</h1>
<p>There are numerous options for developing supervisors, managers, and leaders within the VR organization.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Send employees to national VR leadership programs such as the one at San Diego State University or national non-VR leadership programs such as the one at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. If funds and time are available, this is an excellent option.&nbsp; If funds are available but limited, use these programs for the few individuals in your succession planning process that are likely candidates for high level leadership positions within your organization.</li>
<li>Local colleges and universities may have targeted leadership programs such as leadership programs for women.</li>
<li>Professional associations may have pertinent programs such as CSAVR&rsquo;s training for new state directors.</li>
<li>Look to your state to see what programs are available. Some states may have certificate programs in supervision, management, and/or leadership.&nbsp; While the quality of these programs may vary from state to state, they are often free and only cost the agency associated costs such as the use of a state car.&nbsp; The added value of these programs is that information learned is specific to the rules of your state.&nbsp; For examples, individuals attending these programs would understand exactly how the grievance processes work in your state as opposed to generic information about grievance processes.</li>
<li>Some VR agencies have developed their own in-house programs. This allows the program to be specific to that agency and gives the agency the opportunity to target the message of the training.&nbsp; The issue may be the amount of internal resources devoted to such a program that could be utilized for more agency specific training topics.</li>
<li>Another option is a hybrid program combining state level training programs and VR agency training programs. Kentucky&rsquo;s general VR agency developed such a program with the assistance of their former TACE.&nbsp; Staff have to apply for the program and have the permission of their supervisor to attend.&nbsp; The first phase of the program utilizes state training resources focused on basic supervisory, management, and leadership skills.&nbsp; This consists of a total of 47 hours of required training.&nbsp; The second phase is an internal program that is specific to the specialized skills and knowledge required for positions in the VR agency.&nbsp; Some of the training topics for the second phase include:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When Co-Workers Become Supervisors (Panel Discussion)</li>
<li>Customer Service and the Leadership Role</li>
<li>Leadership Ethics/Dilemmas</li>
<li>Crisis Management</li>
<li>Policy &amp; Procedures for OVR</li>
<li>Accommodation Process</li>
<li>Consumer Appeal/Fair Hearing Process</li>
<li>VR Budgeting</li>
<li>Making the Move into Management&nbsp;</li>
<li>Performance Management &amp; Coaching&nbsp;</li>
<li>Process Management</li>
<li>VR Hiring Process/Post-Interview Process</li>
<li>Trends in VR</li>
<li>OVR Beliefs/Attitudes/Values (Agency Mission and Philosophy)</li>
<li>Project Presentation (This consists of working as a team to present a solution for a current challenge facing the VR agency.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before developing your own VR leadership program, consider what is already available and take advantage of the lessons learned through those programs.&nbsp; For example, the following link, from UACurrents, can be helpful.&nbsp; <a href="http://elmo.uacurrents.org/state-leadership-programs/">http://elmo.uacurrents.org/state-leadership-programs/</a></p>
<p>Because of the amount of resources involved in training new leaders, consider the following points when evaluating which staff would most likely be successful leaders at the conclusion of such a program:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person&rsquo;s current job performance</li>
<li>What their peers, supervisors, and subordinates say about them</li>
<li>The lack of &ldquo;derailment&rdquo; factors such as overly controlling or insensitive.</li>
<li>Having a developed intellect (creative, open-minded, broad range of interests)</li>
<li>Being conscientious</li>
<li>Having surgency (high energy, persuasive, fluent speakers, etc.)</li>
<li>Possessing emotional stability (grace under pressure, flexible, able to handle conflict, etc.)</li>
<li>Being agreeable</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>VR Specific Training</h1>
<p>The VR program is somewhat unique in state government because of the high level of vocational rehabilitation training received by many staff before starting employment at the VR agency.&nbsp; Those trained at the Masters level or holding licensure or certification in vocational rehabilitation is a step ahead of many state agency staff.&nbsp; No matter how great the prior training, the VR world is changing and VR staff need new skills, competencies, and knowledge to be fully efficient given these changes.&nbsp; The passage of WIOA will require changes in many states, and VR employees must meet these new challenges.</p>
<p>The first VR specific training should be for new employees.&nbsp; This training should be a hybrid with your state&rsquo;s new employee orientation or on-boarding process, if available.&nbsp; As part of that training program, new VR employees should learn all the basics about your VR agency (agency mission, values, where to ask for vacation leave, etc.).&nbsp; In conjunction, or as an extension, of this training, new employees should learn about how the VR process works specifically in your organization.&nbsp; This may involve training on the agency&rsquo;s case management system.&nbsp; This training should be accomplished as soon as possible after the new employee is hired.</p>
<p>After the initial training for new employees, the type of specific VR training that may be needed is wide ranging and can change from year to year.&nbsp; Examples of such training may be on updates to VR legislation, how to work with specific populations, new releases in accommodation products, etc.&nbsp; These types of training are typically conducted by in-house staff or an agency partner (e.g., a disability center at a local university).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency can decide which employees are required to attend which training sessions.&nbsp; It is recommended that your in-house administrative staff (including receptionists, fiscal, human resources, etc.) learn as much as possible about the VR process.&nbsp; This greater understanding of VR will make them a better resource for your agency and your employees.</p>
<h1>Specialized Training</h1>
<p>There are certain training programs (either classroom or online) that may be required by your state such as Sexual Harassment Prevention.&nbsp; It is imperative that you ensure your staff attend these required programs.&nbsp; There may be other state programs that are not required, but could be useful for all employees such as effective writing and communication skills or basic and advanced computer skills (some states may offer these programs in conjunction with local technical and community colleges for a negotiated fee.)</p>
<p>VR Directors have indicated a desire to have their employees receive training in project management, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity and innovation, and decision-making.&nbsp; These courses may be offered by your state or your umbrella agency.&nbsp; Some local universities may offer certification in areas like project management and employees could take advantage of some or all of those courses.&nbsp; Remember that large businesses in your area may offer the use of their training staff to provide training in some of these areas as a community service.&nbsp; Another place to find specialized training resources may be local chapters of professional organizations such as the American Society for Quality, the Association for Talent Development, or the Society for Human Resource Management.</p>
<p>Specialized training in areas like creativity and innovation can be a fun anchor for a statewide employee event.&nbsp; This is a time to find a local professional consultant who can both educate and entertain.&nbsp; For a relatively small budget, many employees can receive a consistent message.&nbsp; This training can then be utilized to make other agency events more effective.&nbsp; For example, the general VR agency in Nebraska holds &ldquo;Fed Ex&rdquo; days where employees come up with innovative ideas which could be chosen for further development and/or implementation.&nbsp; Having staff trained ahead of time on creativity techniques could enhance this process.</p>
<p>Remember your employees are the talent that fuels the success of your organization.&nbsp; Investing in them through training and development opportunities is definitely worthwhile not only for them, but for the clients they serve.</p>

<h2>A3. Performance Management</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Performance management:</strong> The process of maintaining or improving employee job performance through the use of performance assessment tools, coaching and counseling as well as providing continuous feedback.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Most state systems have their own performance appraisal systems and required forms.&nbsp; It is important that the VR agency comply with all state and umbrella agency rules and regulations regarding performance management.&nbsp; If performance management is included in any collective bargaining agreement with unions, then that agreement must be followed and any changes normally have to be formally agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>Some state systems, such as North Carolina, have true pay for performance.&nbsp; That state&rsquo;s performance management system documentation can be found here ASSET ID <strong>ADR11</strong></p>
<p>.&nbsp; Other states may have pay increases denied to anyone with an unsatisfactory rating, but not include bonuses for above standard performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most state performance appraisal systems are for individual performance.&nbsp; There are times when team performance may be measured instead of individual performance or included as part of the individual performance rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good performance management systems are not solely focused on a performance rating.&nbsp; The performance rating should be a small part of an overall process that includes continuous feedback and coaching.&nbsp; Talking to an employee once a year is never enough, especially if the performance rating given comes as a surprise to that employee.&nbsp; Many states have employee probationary periods where it is much easier to let go of an employee with poor performance than after he/she completes the probationary period.&nbsp; Effective use of performance planning and appraisal during the probationary period can prevent many headaches later.&nbsp; If uncertain by the end of the probationary period about an employee, and an extension is allowed, then take advantage of this option.</p>
<p>Many states offer formalized training on performance management.&nbsp; It is recommended that supervisors take advantage of any such training.&nbsp; A supervisor&rsquo;s guide on this subject has been provided here ASSET ID <strong>ADR3</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) offers a link to a government performance management framework found at <a href="http://www.nasbo.org/sites/default/files/APerformanceManagementFramework.pdf">http://www.nasbo.org/sites/default/files/APerformanceManagementFramework.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>This toolkit includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance Management Layers</li>
<li>Rationale for Performance Management</li>
<li>Sample Performance Management Memorandum</li>
<li>Tips for Dealing with Problem Employees</li>
<li>Remote Supervision Strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>An optimized organization has many layers of performance management.&nbsp; The least complex layer is the individual performance management cycle, illustrated here:</p>
<p>From blog.competencycore.com</p>
<h1>The graphic shows the Performance Management cycle as a three-step process:</h1>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning. What must be achieved? To what standard? What competencies are needed?&nbsp; What development is needed?</h1>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Progress review: How am I doing? Can I do better? Does anything need to change?</h1>
<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation: How did I do?&nbsp; How can I do better? What Have I learned?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After these three steps, the cycle continues from the beginning.</p>
<p>This individual performance management cycle should be imbedded into and aligned with the organization&rsquo;s overall human resource systems such as reward and recognition, career development and planning, and competencies, which are included elsewhere in this toolkit.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>The performance management system should also align with the agency&rsquo;s strategic planning process.&nbsp; The goals and objectives set forth in the agency&rsquo;s strategic plan should drill down to individual employee performance plans.&nbsp; With this alignment, each employee can understand his/her contribution to the overall goals of the organization.</p>
<h1>There are also performance management systems for the organization as a whole.&nbsp; Individual performance management works best when part of an organizational culture that promotes performance excellence.&nbsp; The following illustration from the Four Pillars Consulting Group indicates how organizations can be developed in stages towards a comprehensive performance management culture.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Association of State Budget Officers cited a publication by the National Performance Management Advisory Commission titled &ldquo;A Performance Management Framework for State and Local Government:&nbsp; From Measurement and Reporting to Management and Improving.&rdquo;&nbsp; This document, whose link is found here, is a good starting place for looking at organizational performance management given that budget offices may drive this issue in state government.</p>
<h1>Rationale for Performance Management</h1>
<p>Performance management is often disliked by employees and supervisors alike.&nbsp; It can be a very stressful process for employees if not conducted using fair and consistent constructive feedback with positive coaching and developmental opportunities.&nbsp; It can be very stressful for supervisors if not properly training in effective communication, coaching, and employee development techniques.&nbsp; Remember that performance management that is not done in the manner recommended can actually reduce employee engagement and productivity.</p>
<p>When done properly, performance management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensures that all state employees are providing productive efforts necessary for achieving quality state services.</li>
<li>Ensures that every employee knows what is expected so they can be fairly evaluated against those objective expectations.</li>
<li>Documents job strengths and weaknesses that can be utilized for corrective action plans and/or career development plans.</li>
<li>Creates a performance record that can be utilized for either performance accountability or promotion.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A4. Pay Strategies</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In state government systems, any monies given to individual employees is typically tightly controlled.&nbsp; While the VR agency may have some hourly employees, most VR Counselors and other permanent VR employees receive an annual salary.&nbsp; In many systems, these salaries are difficult to change once the initial salary level has been set except for any across the board pay increases granted by the state or when promoted.&nbsp; For this reason, it may be important to see if <u>advanced starting salaries</u> are available.&nbsp; Typically, advanced starting salaries are granted for either excessive qualifications or because of lack of qualified applicants.&nbsp; An example of excessive qualifications might be an applicant for a vacant VR Counselor I who is relocating from another state who has 20 years of relevant VR experience.&nbsp; In some states, hiring managers are entitled to a minimum number of qualified applicants on a certification or hiring list.&nbsp; If that number is not reached, then the agency can ask for an advanced salary for one of the qualified applicants on that list.</p>
<p>Another opportunity that may be available is to increase a salary above the normal promotional rate upon promotion.&nbsp; For example, after being hired as a VR Counselor II, someone may have completed their doctorate in vocational rehabilitation.&nbsp; Then, when that person is promoted to a VR Counselor III, they could possibly receive larger than the normal promotional increase because of &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; qualifications.</p>
<p>Caution should be taken when increasing pay for a single employee, especially if that employee is part of a larger group of employees with the same classification.&nbsp; This can create negative feelings among the employees not receiving the increases and decrease their productivity.</p>
<p>There are strategies for assisting groups of employees and/or to help employees understand all of the benefits they are receiving.&nbsp; Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total compensation summaries or calculators. This strategy is detailed later in this toolkit.</li>
<li>Selective market variation (SMV) is a process used to increase the salary range for job classifications where severe market competition makes it difficult for the state to recruit and retain qualified employees. States may have specific formulas to determine which classification will qualify for SMV.&nbsp; Typically there is a history of lack of qualified applicants on hiring or certification lists despite sincere attempts to widely advertise the positions.</li>
<li>Special classifications can be used where there are groups of employees who prefer not to go into supervision, but may leave without a salary increase. An example would be to develop a Master VR Counselor classification that would be a difficult level to achieve, but an alternative to a VR Counselor Supervisor.</li>
<li>There are times when the cost of living in certain areas of a state are much higher than in other parts of the state. To recruit and retain individuals in these areas, sometimes a geographic differential is offered so that employees working in these areas receive a higher salary than those working in another part of the state.</li>
<li>Often reclassification of positions can be utilized to increase the salary of an individual or a group of individuals. This is typically easier to accomplish with job titles that are unique to VR as opposed to generic titles used by other agencies as that would increase the cost to the state of upgrading those classifications.</li>
<li>Depending on the politics in your state, you can appeal directly to the state legislature for VR pay increases.</li>
<li>Another option is to provide bonuses for those individuals with special skills such as sign language or a foreign language.</li>
<li>While VR agencies tend to work the same basic hours as other state agencies, one idea would be to extend hours and provide overtime or a shift differential to employees working non-typical hours. This option may become more feasible as VR services and clients change in the future.</li>
<li>In some states, pay for performance is available and can be utilized.</li>
<li>When none of these pay options are possible, please refer to other sections of the toolkit for non-monetary options.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A5. Exit Interviews</h2>
<h1><u>Definition</u></h1>
<p>An interview conducted at the time of the employee&rsquo;s resignation, used to identify the underlying factors behind an employee&rsquo;s decision to leave.</p>
<p><u>Methods</u></p>
<p>The exit interview may be conducted in a number of ways.&nbsp; It can be done as an online survey, through phone or in-person interviews, or as a mailed survey (with a return envelope and postage).&nbsp; There are pros and cons with each option.&nbsp; Phone or in-person interviews provide an opportunity to engage the individual in a more detailed manner as well as provide opportunities to create a rapport if one does not exist.&nbsp; These interviews can require staff resources that may not be easily available.&nbsp; Written and online surveys can be quick and easy to administer, but the level of detail may be lack.&nbsp; Also, the response rates of written and online surveys may not be as high as phone or in-person interviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is recommended that the surveys be conducted in such a manner that respondents feel comfortable providing honest feedback.&nbsp; Therefore, it may be most advantageous to have the exit interview conducted by individuals unlikely to be asked for job references such as direct supervisors.&nbsp; Exit interviews are typically voluntary and conducted by human resource staff, if available.</p>
<p><u>Uses</u></p>
<p>The exit interview can have multiple uses.&nbsp; It may provide valuable information about a possible bully or sexual harasser in the agency.&nbsp; It may provide information that is useful for the agency&rsquo;s recruitment and/or retention plans in terms of what is working and what is not working. &nbsp;If done in person, the exit interview can be an appropriate time to collect anything belonging to the organization such as keys, equipment, ID badges, etc.</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; While exit interviews can be extremely useful, do not neglect to obtain information from your employees concerning why they choose to stay.&nbsp; This information can be equally useful.</p>

<h1>Items to Assist Retention</h1>
<p>Here is a link ASSET ID <strong>US E. DVW2</strong> to items that can assist retention.&nbsp; Some items can be more easily implemented in state government than others, but do not throw out an item before careful reflection or checking to see if other states have accomplished this.</p>
<p>A principle mentioned in the employee recognition section also applies to employee retention.&nbsp; That principle is that one size does not fit all.&nbsp; What is important to one employee when making a decision to stay with an organization is not the same as what may be important to another employee when making that same decision.&nbsp; Consider the need for workplace flexibility.&nbsp; For one employee, this may be needed because of family needs.&nbsp; Other employees may need workplace flexibility because of their age, faith, energy levels, disabilities, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retention of the Differing Generations in the Workplace</p>
<p>There are many generations currently working together in the workforce.&nbsp; These generations have been categorized in many ways and with different dates of birth, but here is one example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silent or Veteran Generation (born 1925-45) [Note the majority of this group is likely retired so will not be dealt with in this section.]</li>
<li>Baby Boomers (born 1946-1962) [Note members of this group are currently retiring.]</li>
<li>Cuspers (born 1963-1964) [Note this group is often combined with the Baby Boomer group and will be treated as such here.]</li>
<li>Gen Xers (born 1965-1983)</li>
<li>Gen Yers or Millennials (born 1984-1999)</li>
<li>Gen Z (born 2000 or later) [Note this group is just getting ready to enter the workforce.]</li>
</ul>
<p>Those groupings of employees are useful, as employees in the same generational cohort may have experienced similar life events or trends (e.g., World War II, personal computers available in the home, etc.).&nbsp; However, it is important to remember that these generational cohorts should not be stereotype and the following tips are offered as helpful guidelines understanding that all employees, no matter the generation into which they were born, are unique.</p>
<p>The following is with thanks to SSA Consultants, Inc., Zemke, Raines &amp; Filipczak, Modern Healthcare Magazine, The Whitten Group, Federal Office of Personnel Management, Hayberg Consulting Group, Rowell Consulting Group, and Management Education Group.</p>
<p><u>Principles for Recruiting and Retaining Various Groups</u></p>
<p>Baby Boomers:&nbsp; Let them know their experience will be valued; challenge them to be a change agent; Show them places where they can excel; stress that is a warm humane place to work; focus on problems that they can solve to turn things around; let them see their work in the larger context; reward their work ethic and long hours; Give lots of public recognition</p>
<p>Xers:&nbsp; Say &ldquo;We want you to have a life&rdquo; at least three times during the interview; Let them know that ideas are evaluated by merit and not by a person&rsquo;s years of experience; Do not discuss being a change agent; Talk about how your agency wants employees to broaden their skills; Use the phrase &ldquo;hands off supervision&rdquo;; Stress that you will need them to manage multiple projects at a time; Give them a list of who to call for more information on a variety of subjects; Allow them to prioritize work tasks in their own way; Provide constructive daily feedback; Give them elbow room; Provide them with the latest technology as possible; Make sure their manager strives for excellence, helps them, is willing to learn from them, and will provide them with individual development opportunities</p>
<p>Yers:&nbsp; Have a large social media presence (and make sure websites, etc. are updated); Offer flexible work options including flexible schedules and telecommuting; Emphasize the social good that VR does; Discuss development and feedback opportunities; Encourage peer recognition; Provide short-term goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Zers:&nbsp; Tell them they will be taken seriously despite their newness in the organization; Discuss the honesty of the agency leader and the transparency of the organization; Explain how they can be involved in new projects for the agency; Make them feel part of a community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Strategies for Retaining Minority Employees</h1>
<p>As the demographics of those served by your agency, along with the changing demographics of your workforce, it is important to create a welcoming place that values all.&nbsp; Strategies for retaining minority employees fall into two basic categories.&nbsp; The first category is those strategies that assist in the retention of all staff, including minorities and differing generations.&nbsp; Those strategies were addressed above.&nbsp; The second category is retention strategies specific to minority employees, addressed below, and strategies for various generations found in the next section.</p>
<p>Many strategies appropriate for the recruitment of minority staff go hand-in-hand with the retention of minority staff.&nbsp; It is important that the agency develop a positive reputation for the treatment of minority staff based upon how it treats existing employees.&nbsp; It goes without saying that any observed discrimination or intolerance should be immediately addressed by the organization.&nbsp; However, it is often the subtle forms of discrimination and bias that are more difficult to overcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One strategy is ensuring that all staff are trained on micro inequities<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and how to detect and prevent subtle forms of bias.&nbsp; Your local chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management can assist in finding applicable training providers.&nbsp; Another strategy is to propose diversity support groups or initiate dialogue about how to make the workplace more supportive of diverse members.&nbsp; Consider chartering a workplace diversity committee.&nbsp; A development opportunity for staff might include a research project on what new programs are available for supporting minority staff in the workplace.&nbsp; If a formal mentoring program is not available, the agency can be supportive of senior minority staff informally mentoring new minority employees.&nbsp; This mentoring can have positive impacts for both the mentor and mentee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VR agencies working with clients with disabilities should ensure its considerable expertise is utilized in meeting the accommodation needs of its disabled workforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work with your human resource representative to monitor the statistics in your organization.&nbsp; For example, are minority employees promoted or allowed to attend training and conferences at the same rate as other employees?&nbsp; Review the composition of the agency&rsquo;s leadership team to determine if minorities are represented consistently in your available workforce.&nbsp; If the answer is no, then an analysis should be conducted of the barriers preventing minorities from reaching high levels in your organization.&nbsp; That analysis should be followed by action steps to address the barriers.&nbsp; It is important for minority staff, as for all staff, to see examples of how people like them can be successful in the organization.</p>
<h1>Creating a Retention Plan</h1>
<p>It is easy to create a retention plan utilizing a simple spreadsheet with headings as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action Step</li>
<li>Lead Staff</li>
<li>Other Parties</li>
<li>Contractor: Yes or No</li>
<li>Costs</li>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Significant Milestones</li>
<li>Policy/Procedure Implications</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine which action steps are to be included in the plan, data gathering is required.&nbsp; Look at any available exit interviews or data to determine the reasons that people are leaving your organization.&nbsp; Some of these reasons, such as low salaries, may not be in the VR agency&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; For reasons that can be controlled by the VR agency, action steps should be developed and included in the retention plan.</p>
<p>Another way to determine which action steps should be included is to survey your employees.&nbsp; If doing so, be careful to not include items that are known to be impossible to implement and word the survey so that expectations are not unrealistically raised.&nbsp; Determining which items to include can come from many sources.&nbsp; A list of potential items is included in the next section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Job Classification</h1>
<p>Proper job classification is directly related to how much an employee is paid which can impact job retention.&nbsp; This section provides information on that important topic.</p>
<p><u>Definitions</u></p>
<p>Job analysis:&nbsp; The systematic process of gathering and examining and interpreting data regarding the specific tasks comprising a job.</p>
<p>Job classification:&nbsp; A method of evaluation used for job comparisons, which groups jobs into a prearranged number of grades, each having a class description and a specified pay range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Job codes:&nbsp; Identification numbers assigned to specific jobs or job tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Job description:&nbsp; A written description of a job which includes information regarding the general nature of the work to be performed, specific responsibilities and duties, and the employee characteristics required to perform the job.</p>
<p>Job evaluation:&nbsp; Used for compensation planning purposes, it is the process of comparing a job with other jobs in an organization to determine an appropriate pay rate for the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Job grade:&nbsp; The group into which jobs of the same or similar worth are placed for determining appropriate rates of pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Job group:&nbsp; A division within the contractor's workforce for the purposes of analyzing the workforce for underutilization. Job grouping is done to group job titles together based on similarity of job content, pay rates and opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p><u>Background</u></p>
<p>Each state system has its own process for analyzing jobs and determing the classification and pay grade (job grade) of each position.&nbsp; Typically, these is done by the state&rsquo;s human resource/personnel office although both the affected agency and umbrella agency may have input into the process.&nbsp; Job classification is a critical process for VR agencies in that it determines the range of pay available to VR employees.&nbsp; While pay is not the only component, it can be an important component in the recruitment and retention of staff.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Navigating the Classification Process</h3>
<p>There are several ways in which the state&rsquo;s human resource office may entertain reviewing existing job classifications.&nbsp; One option is to ask for a maintenance review of all similar jobs such as VR Counselors if the classification has not been updated in many years.&nbsp; The VR agency could also request a reclassification of all VR Counselors based on recent environmental factors such as newly required state licensure for VR Counselors.&nbsp; Another option is to request a reclassification for an individual position if one position has been given new duties.</p>
<p>Remember that many states utilized Hay Methodology in their classification process.&nbsp; This process looks at factors such as &ldquo;Know-how&rdquo;, &ldquo;Problem Solving&rdquo;, &ldquo;Accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;Working Conditions&rdquo;.&nbsp; The more points a position gets on each of these factors, the higher the assigned associated pay grade.&nbsp; For VR Counselors, emphasize the degree of training required for their jobs (if your state requires a Masters&rsquo; degree this is particularly helpful).&nbsp; If supervision is required, then additional points may be assigned.&nbsp; The range and type of individuals with which a VR Counselor may need to successfully interact (clients, CAP program, etc.) can also provide points.&nbsp; While the specific point system for your state may be held confidentially, there are now generic sources available on the Internet that can assist you in &ldquo;beefing up&rdquo; any classification forms you may need to fill out.</p>
<p>It is helpful to work with your state&rsquo;s human resource office to develop a career ladder for VR Counselor positions.&nbsp; A career ladder is a hierarchy of similar positions such as VR Assistant, VR Counselor I, VR Counselor II, VR Counselor III, and VR Supervisor.&nbsp; In some states the career ladder goes further in that a group of similar jobs is included in the same budgeted position.&nbsp; For example, a job may be classified as a VR Counselor III, but the agency can post and fill the position as either a VR Counselor I, a VR Counselor II, or a VR Counselor III.&nbsp; If the position is filled as a VR Counselor I, the incumbent does not have to compete for a VR Counselor II position in order to get promoted.&nbsp; That individual would only need to complete specific requirements in order to be promoted within that same budgeted position.&nbsp; This system is very helpful in that staff can easily see that a promotion is available and that it is based on their own training and experience.</p>
<h3>Job Description Discussion</h3>
<p>Job descriptions should include competencies required for the job.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most states have not had the time or resources to make this change.&nbsp; Therefore sample VR Counselor competencies are included elsewhere in this toolkit and not as part of the sample job descriptions.</p>
<p>Since the author is most familiar with the state of Delaware, that state&rsquo;s classification of VR positions is examined including the current structure and a recommended structure to provide assistance to other states working on VR job classification.&nbsp; Delaware&rsquo;s VR job descriptions can be found here ASSET ID <strong>US D. OBW9</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The current structure of VR titles is as follows (in a system where pay grades range from 1 to 24 and salary range provided is based on 2015 pay tables).&nbsp; It should be noted that most state of Delaware employees are at or below the midpoint of the shown pay range.)</p>

<p>The VR Director is an appointed position.</p>
<p>The general VR agency in Delaware also uses a career ladder position (all positions classified at the III level with the ability to recruit at any of the three levels) traditionally utilized in the employment and training system.&nbsp; That career ladder is as follows:</p>
<p>Employment Services Specialist I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $29,384-$44,076</p>
<p>Employment Services Specialist II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $33,638-$50,456</p>
<p>Employment Services Specialist III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $35,994-$53,990</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, as pay grades increase the level of education and experience should also increase, and the above should be reviewed to ensure that the rationale for this not being the case is valid.&nbsp; A non-valid reason for this variation would be the establishment of minimum job requirements based on individual employees (e.g., trying to get a specific individual hired or promoted).&nbsp; A valid reason for an exception may be that for some positions, administrative, management, or supervisory experience may be more desired than specific education.</p>
<p>The employment services specialist positions were written as a class series where levels of work and knowledge, skills and abilities built in a linear fashion from the Employment Services Specialist I to the Employment Services Supervisor.&nbsp; It is recommended that the VR class series be developed in a similar manner for more consistency across the levels of VR work.</p>
<p>It is always a challenge to develop minimum job requirements.&nbsp; They need to be strong enough to support high enough pay grades to attract and retain the best staff.&nbsp; They also need to not create adverse impact or prevent employment of individuals capable of performing the job adequately with minimal on-the-job training.&nbsp; Everyone knows of individuals lacking the education of other staff, but who are much better at their jobs.&nbsp; There will always be those exceptions (and those good employees should be targets for tuition reimbursement and similar programs to increase their level of education), but the rule should be what is needed for the average employee to do the average job.</p>
<p>Since Delaware is a smaller program than many states, there is not a VR Counselor Supervisor classification.&nbsp; For larger states, it is recommended to have both a supervisor classification and a Master Counselor classification.&nbsp; Often VR Counselors are rapidly promoted through the equivalent of a VR Counselor II or III level which is helpful to staff retention early in the counselors&rsquo; career.&nbsp; However, more senior personnel also need promotional opportunities.&nbsp; For some, going into supervision or administration is desired and a good fit for the skills and competencies of those individuals.&nbsp; For others who love what they do, and have become experts at their craft, a promotional vehicle should be made available.&nbsp; The best counselors do not always make the best supervisors.</p>
<p>Another issue in this state, and in many states, is the lack of appropriate job classifications for professionals working with businesses.&nbsp; It would seem that those trying to develop relationships with businesses to secure jobs for agency clients would hold degrees in business and/or have sales experience to be able to communicate with business in the language of business.&nbsp; The employment services specialist class series lacks a professional identity.&nbsp; With the new emphasis on employment in WIOA, the use of business and employment professionals is more of a priority than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will always be some counselors that are excellent at job development and working with businesses, but this is a different skill set than being a good counselor and understanding disabilities.&nbsp; Those counselors good at job development are appropriate for dual customer approaches where the counselor is responsible for all job development and placement as well as counseling.&nbsp; This approach fails, or at least creates tension, when counselors are not skilled at both approaches.&nbsp; Even if counselors lack business skills, it is important that they at least understand the job development world.&nbsp; Currently, many master level VR programs do not emphasize the employment aspect of vocational rehabilitation.&nbsp; This is understandable as they are operating under strict rules for the accreditation of their programs.&nbsp; It is hoped that those requirements will be updated given the enactment of WIOA.</p>
<p>While each state is unique, it is unexpected to see so many differences in the classification of vocational rehabilitation experts across the country.&nbsp; A base level of standardization could assist the promotion of vocational rehabilitation as a profession.</p>

<h1>Ideas for Retaining Top Performers</h1>
<p>It is important to retain top performers as they typically account for a significantly higher percentage of productivity than do average employees.&nbsp; The loss of top performers can hurt an organization much more than normal turnover.</p>
<p>Adopting the practices suggested in other parts of this toolkit, particularly the retention, performance management, and staff training and career development sections is a great start in trying to retain all employees, including top performers.&nbsp; The important point is that the organization should ensure that the career development planning, recognition, and performance management processes for top performers are done by someone with the right skills.&nbsp; It is imperative to find out what is important to the top performer be it a flexible schedule, tuition reimbursement, special assignment, opportunities to job shadow someone in management, etc.&nbsp; Meeting the needs of this employee helps assure that the employee will stay, particularly if this employee is high in reciprocity (believing that if someone does something for them, then they should reciprocate).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many states lack the opportunity to provide extra salary or bonus dollars to these top performers, making it imperative to tap into other possibilities.&nbsp; Often the VR Director is able to offer a special &ldquo;Director&rsquo;s Award&rdquo; as part of the employee recognition process.&nbsp; A framed award certificate and public recognition can help in retaining these highly valuable staff.</p>
<p>If training and travel funds to conferences are scare, it is not unreasonable to allocate scare available resources to top performers&mdash;they have earned this through their hard work.&nbsp; It may also motivate other employees who are told that if their performance reaches a critical threshold that they may also be eligible for such perks.&nbsp; Be fair to all employees by setting a consistent standard and applying that to all individuals.</p>
<p>The bottom line is to let valued employees know their value is recognized and appreciated - as often as possible in a genuine way.</p>
<h3>Performance Management</h3>

<h1>Change Management/Organizational Development</h1>
<p>Because of the importance of organizational culture to employee retention, this section on change management and organizational development is provided for those wanting to take steps to improve the culture of their VR agency.</p>
<p><u>Definitions</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Change Management: The systematic approach and application of knowledge, tools and resources to deal with change. Change management means defining and adopting corporate strategies, structures, procedures and technologies to deal with changes in external conditions and the business environment.</li>
<li>Organization Development: A planned organization-wide effort to improve and increase the organization&rsquo;s effectiveness, productivity, return on investment and overall employee job satisfaction through planned interventions in the organization's processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Background</u></p>
<p>As gleamed from the definitions, organization development and change management are different but related.&nbsp; For the purpose of this document, they will be used interchangeably since both deal with changes to improve an organization.&nbsp; While on the surface, change management appears self-explanatory and fairly easy, it is extremely difficult to accomplish, except for the smallest change efforts, since there are a host of dynamics involved in change.&nbsp; Because of this, it is recommended that VR agencies utilize a professional to work closely with the agency in any change management/organization development effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Getting Started</u></p>
<p>Remember that project management plans and techniques can be a great resource in assisting any change management/organization development project.</p>
<p>Also, if teams are involved in either leading the change effort or being directly impacted by the change effort, then beginning the process with facilitated team-building can lay a strong foundation.</p>
<p>Having a strong understanding of your organization prior to any change management effort is important.&nbsp; There are many diagnostic tools to assess everything from the level of trust to the view of current leadership in the organization.&nbsp; Assessments can even be made of employees&rsquo; views concerning change.</p>
<p>Leadership must be fully and actively supportive of any change effort.&nbsp; Having the initial communication about the change effort coming from the VR Director is important.&nbsp; This first communication, which should be part of a pre-planned communication strategy, must clearly outline the rationale and urgency for the change.&nbsp; The first thing that every employee wants to know is how the change effort will impact them personally.&nbsp; Clarify generally whether or not staff changes are expected.&nbsp; If none are expected, then be clear about that from the beginning to reduce anxiety levels.&nbsp; Provide transition tips for everyone such as being flexible especially if answers are not immediately available.</p>
<p>The vision of what the agency will look like after the change has been accomplished should be part of the original message from the VR Director.&nbsp; This vision should be well thought out and provided in both written and visual formats if appropriate.</p>
<p>The VR Director should ensure that his/her leadership team is onboard with the change efforts.&nbsp; If the changes will impact the leadership team, this is another time that professional assistance should be sought.</p>
<p><u>Checklist</u></p>
<p>The Harvard Business Review provided &ldquo;Eight Steps to Transforming Your Organization&rdquo; which can serve as a quick checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a Sense of Urgency</li>
<li>Forming a Powerful Guiding Coalition</li>
<li>Creating a Vision</li>
<li>Communicating the Vision</li>
<li>Empowering Others to Act on the Vision</li>
<li>Planning for and Creating Short-Term Wins</li>
<li>Consolidating Improvements and Producing Still More Change</li>
<li>Institutionalizing New Approaches</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Types of Change Management Projects</u></p>
<p>One major change management effort involves implementing new computer systems.&nbsp; While this type of change can involve much time and hard work, it is one of the easier change management efforts to plan and implement because of the large amount of available models.&nbsp; These models can be modified to fit your specific circumstances, but they typically lead you in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to identify all of the resources required for the change management effort</li>
<li>How to identify each change in business processes and how to develop a change management plan for each process being altered.</li>
<li>How to assess and manage the readiness for change of all involved stakeholders, including the development of detailed training plans.</li>
<li>How to manage the transition from the old system to the new system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any change management effort becomes immediately more complicated if there are any major changes to staff.&nbsp; If there are organizational structure changes, that also complicates the change effort.&nbsp; In these cases the new organizational charts should be communicated as soon as possible, but not until there has been private communication with each individual significantly impacted.&nbsp; The items constituting a significant change would be changes in pay, basic duties or job classification, location or supervision.&nbsp; If a large group of employees is having the same change in supervision or location, then those employees could be met with as a group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the change effort will have significant impacts on specific employees a separate communication plan should be developed with bullet points of the individual message to be delivered to each impacted employee.&nbsp; That information is then consolidated into a detailed plan which outlines the exact time and place of each individual meeting including the participants in that meeting.&nbsp; The plan should include if certain individuals needed to be briefed on their cell phone immediately following any of the individual meetings.&nbsp; The timing should be carefully planned so that some individuals are briefed simultaneously to prevent one person from knowing information before a similar person.&nbsp; Team meetings with various groups are scheduled after the meetings with impacted individuals has been completed.&nbsp; Key communicators in the change process should be given individual schedules so they are in the right place at the right time.&nbsp; Again, if more than a couple individuals are impacted, it is highly recommended to obtain assistance from a professional as working out the correct messaging, etc. can be critical to the success of the effort.</p>
<p><u>Resistance to Change</u></p>
<p>There are many dynamics involved in the change process.&nbsp; One such dynamic is resistance to change.&nbsp; It is important to note that most people have some resistance to change even if they understand the rationale and support the change.&nbsp; Change can be resisted if staff do not feel that change is needed, has a clear purpose, or that the change will only benefit a few individuals and not them.&nbsp; Poor communication can create resistance as well as distrust in the person leading the change.&nbsp; High work pressures and fear of failure can also create resistance.&nbsp; It is important not to ignore the existing agency culture during change efforts as that could further lead to change resistance.</p>
<p>It is important to study all the dynamics of change, or to engage a professional, before embarking on a major change effort.</p>

<h3>Total Compensation</h3>
<p><u>Background</u></p>
<p>Retaining productive employees is a challenge for many state agencies.&nbsp; One tool that may assist in this process is the development of a total compensation summary that can be presented annually to employees.&nbsp; The National Association of State Personnel Executives (NASPE) listed total compensation in its top five issues list for 2014.&nbsp; As they stated, &ldquo;State governments have historically been known to offer great benefits but pay often lags behind the market.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often employees do not realize the richness of all they receive and could be lured by a higher salary not understanding that their overall compensation.&nbsp; Further, by marketing total compensation on the agency&rsquo;s job website, and by word of mouth from current employees, it can be an effective recruitment tool for agencies.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Total Compensation Calculator&rdquo; on agency recruitment websites is an easy way to show potential employees the actual value of a job with that agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Developing Total Compensation Tools</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>TOTAL COMPENSATION SUMMARY</u></strong></p>
<p>When developing a total compensation summary for your employees, it is helpful to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any information concerning the data itself (e.g., annualized as of X date).&nbsp; Include any caveats about the data.</li>
<li>Show the data both as a pie chart and as a table.&nbsp; For example, the pie chart may show that base pay is 70% of total compensation while benefits represent 30%.&nbsp; For the table, if there are costs the employee pays as well as the state, then break down those costs.&nbsp; For example, the employee pays $2000 per year for his/her health insurance while the state pays an additional $15,000 towards that benefit.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Showing what an employee&rsquo;s paid time off (e.g., sick leave, vacation leave, and holidays) equates to in dollars is also recommended.</li>
<li>If your state does not do this yet for state employees, ask if they will consider doing so or at least let you pilot this in your agency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>TOTAL COMPENSATION CALCULATOR</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total compensation calculator is a simple device that employees or applicants can utilized at any time by going to the state&rsquo;s or agency&rsquo;s website.&nbsp; It is intended to give employees a rough estimate of how much additional compensation they receive beyond base pay.&nbsp; It is helpful for applicants to understand the potential value of a particular position beyond the pay listed on a job posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For applicants, it may be important to have options of inputting either a salary amount or a paygrade as some job postings provide salary ranges rather than an exact salary figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, if your state&rsquo;s website does not have a total compensation calculator, ask if it can be added or if this option can be piloted on your agency&rsquo;s website.</p>
