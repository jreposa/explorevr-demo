                        <h1>Metrics</h1>

<p>VR professionals understand the importance of data (number of successful case closures, average wages, etc.) to the management of their agency and its services.&nbsp; Data is similarly important to managing the lifeblood of any organization--its employees.</p>
<p>Some VR staff have direct access to an automated human resource/payroll system at the state or umbrella agency.&nbsp; Often, data from these systems can be easily downloaded into a spreadsheet such as EXCEL where the data can be sorted and manipulated as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data available on these systems will vary from state to state.&nbsp; If there is no access to this data, it is important to obtain system access or have someone supply the data for the agency (add link for Tools for VR Directors with Human Resource Issues ASSET ID <strong>ADR14</strong>).</p>
<p>One extremely important piece of data, easily obtained for most agencies, is turnover data.&nbsp; Several &ldquo;turnover rate&rdquo; metrics provide insight into staff dynamics and help identify strategies to strengthen and improve the workforce.&nbsp; <strong>Basic turnover rate</strong>: the turnover rate is the number of employees leaving during a month or year divided by the total number of employees for that same time period. &nbsp;While this basic turnover statistic is helpful, it is valuable to look at turnover from a variety of perspectives.&nbsp; <strong>High Performers Turnover Rate</strong>: For example, instead of looking only at overall turnover (as in the example above), compute the same rate for the best, most productive employees.&nbsp; If this turnover rate is higher than the overall turnover rate, it is crucial to find ways to retain these most valuable employees.&nbsp; <strong>Voluntary Turnover Rate</strong>: It is also helpful to look at turnover in terms of voluntary and involuntary turnover.&nbsp; If employees are leaving because they have been fired or forced to resign, then subtract that number of employees from the total number of employees leaving to get the voluntary turnover rate.&nbsp; Involuntary turnover can be a good thing for the VR agency as it means that losing some unproductive or problem employees.&nbsp; <strong>Retirement Turnover Rate</strong>: Similarly, it is helpful to separate out those who are leaving for retirement from other turnover.&nbsp; This turnover rate will tell another story about why people are leaving your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obtain and use data that will help you decide what interventions may be needed!</p>
<p>Other examples of helpful statistics are:</p>
<p>-number of days to fill a vacancy</p>
<p>-percentage of employees receiving performance evaluation scores in each category (e.g. unsatisfactory, meets expectations, etc.)</p>
<p>-detailed list of employees eligible to retire in the next five years</p>
<p>-employee data by race, sex, age, and disability to compare with similar data for the clients served by the agency (breakdowns by regions or offices can be helpful).</p>
<p>More detailed information on HR data and metrics can be found in the National Association of State Personnel Executives HR Metrics highlights document per the following link ASSET ID <strong>MET2</strong>.</p>
<h1>Flowcharting: Reviewing Workforce Processes</h1>
<p>Creating flowcharts is one way to review how important human resource processes are working in a VR agency.&nbsp; For example, if the hiring process seems slow and good candidates are lost during the hiring process, a flowchart may help find areas of the hiring process that can be improved.</p>
<p>A simple flowchart process: There are software programs and standard symbols that can be utilized for flowcharting, but for agency HR issues, the simple process described below (adapted from the American Society for Quality) should work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify individuals involved in the process to be flowcharted and include these individuals in the flowcharting process.&nbsp; This may involve asking your HR representative to be part of the process.&nbsp; This has may have the added benefit of getting HR involved in assisting with any potential solutions.</li>
<li>Begin by defining the process to be flowcharted, give it a title, and write the title where all participants in the session can see it.</li>
<li>Decide the parameters of the flow chart. Where will the process start and where does it end?&nbsp; How much detail will be included in the process?</li>
<li>Have participants brainstorm about the process and write each identified process activities on a post-it note.</li>
<li>Take all the activities listed on the post-it notes and arrange them in sequence.</li>
<li>Get agreement that all activities have been included and that they are in the correct sequence.</li>
<li>Determine if there are current steps that can be eliminated or done more quickly.</li>
<li>Review the results with important stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
