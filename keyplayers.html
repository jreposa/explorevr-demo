                        <h1>Key Players</h1>


<p><strong>Internal</strong></p>
<p>Most VR agencies have at least one individual who is the point person for all workforce or personnel issues.&nbsp; This person varies across agencies from the Deputy Director to a full-time internal human resource representative.&nbsp; If the VR agency is part of a larger umbrella agency, then that department may have a human resource office or representative that also works with VR.&nbsp; If the VR agency is unionized, then the local union representative working on the VR agency may be a key player.</p>
<p>In field offices, supervisors play a key role in essential HR functions such as personnel reviews, documentation, and quality management.&nbsp; This HR responsibility is important in all levels of VR management.</p>
<p><strong>External</strong></p>
<p>Most states have statewide office(s) dealing with workforce issues.&nbsp; These offices may have different titles ranging from Human Resources and Personnel to Civil Service or Labor Relations.&nbsp; These offices set many of the workforce system rules under which VR agencies must operate.</p>
<p>Other key players in state workforce systems may include statewide labor unions, recruitment resources (e.g., colleges, community organizations, etc.), the state budget office that may control the amount of positions allocated to the VR agency, and organizations providing training opportunities for VR staff.&nbsp; Since VR agencies are in contact with many agencies and groups in their service to VR clients, many opportunities for partnerships and collaborations exist which could result in other key players in workforce processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Labor Management</h1>
<p>For agencies with unions, those relations can impact many activities involved in employee retention.&nbsp; For that reason, this section on labor management activities has been included.</p>
<p>This section is primarily intended for those states with unions/collective bargaining agreements.&nbsp; However, these principles can be helpful in the maintenance of good relations between management and VR employees in non-union states.</p>
<p>While it is important that VR agencies comply with all terms of any signed collective bargaining agreement, it is helpful if that compliance is combined with cooperation.&nbsp; Moving beyond compliance into cooperation is important for improving labor management relationships.</p>
<p>The relationship between unions and management is impacted by many of the same dynamics underlying any relationship.&nbsp; Trust is essential.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the history of labor relations in this country has often been marked by turmoil and disagreements which can flavor current perceptions around this topic.&nbsp; If the history of labor relations in your agency is an issue, then the first task is working to repair that relationship.&nbsp; This can feel like a daunting task.&nbsp; The first step is getting to know your local union representatives.&nbsp; Discover which representatives are most likely to be interested in working with management towards improving both the agency and working life for employees.&nbsp; Initially, spend your energy on developing a relationship with these individuals instead of wasting your energy on those individuals who are not receptive.&nbsp; The non-receptive individuals are more likely to come around after seeing and hearing about the positive relationship developed with their fellow union representatives.&nbsp; It is at that point that spending energy on those individuals may be most productive.</p>
<p>The key to successful labor management relationships is honesty.&nbsp; This is the basis for trust filled relationships.&nbsp; This does not mean that all management secrets are to be shared with labor, but it does mean that no lies are told and that information important to labor is shared in a well thought out strategy at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>It is also important to be fair when there are issues that arise in the workplace.&nbsp; There are times when problems are created by or as a result of bad supervision.&nbsp; If the supervisor is the one who is clearly wrong in the situation, do not support that supervisor.&nbsp; It sends a message that employees will be treated unfairly in all situations.&nbsp; This is not the message that management should be sending.&nbsp; In these situations, management should also take action to improve the bad supervision.</p>
<p>One idea to enhance labor management relations is to have human resource policies and practices that are favorable to employees without giving up the rights of management.&nbsp; Many of the sample policies and practices in this toolkit can be helpful with this.</p>
<p>Another idea is to form a labor-management committee.&nbsp; This can be a formal or informal committee.&nbsp; It is helpful to start with a simple problem that can be solved by the committee.&nbsp; It is important to pick issues that would not be covered by the collective bargaining agreement, but it can open an important channel of communication.&nbsp; Examples of problems solved include creating wellness programs and identifying training needs.&nbsp; Labor management committees are not panaceas and can be difficult to manage.&nbsp; The toolkit includes materials to assist with the creation and maintenance of labor management committees.</p>
